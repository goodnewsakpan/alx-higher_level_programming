 At the end of this project, I should have handled the following- 
 What function would you use to get the type of an object?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ()
How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ()
And several other .txt files.
